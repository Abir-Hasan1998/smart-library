ABSTRACT: 
Library is place where all kind of books are available. E-Library Management system is a web based application. This system contains list of all the books and can be accessed by remote users concurrently from anywhere in the campus. But for that users must be registered user. This system is three tier architecture.Client sends requests on receiving the request the server processes it and extracts the data from database and sends the result back to the client. This system provides separate interface and login for librarian, students and faculties. Librarian can modify database.Users can search for books and renewal books online. They canrecommend for new books by just sending messages to the librarian from anywhere in the university. They can view the issue and return dates of any book and due they have to pay. This system generates reports that can be used in analying the library performance. Thus the management can take appropriate steps to improve the facilities.

Aim:
To develop a web based library management system using PHP and MYSQL database.

Objectives:
✓ To design a web based library management system using the modeling techniques.
✓ To create the required web pages and add the PHP code.
✓ To develop the required database using MYSQL and establish the database connections required.
✓ To test the application against few test cases and run the application to generalize a web based library management that suits for a general purpose community library.

Scope & Methodology:
Scope of the project is to create a web based library management system. The main reason behind to create a web based application is that to create the mobility to operate even when the admin is out of office and the library members and visitors are away from library physically. All the status of books, article, journals and publications can be updated or viewed using this website and also all the issues and returns of the books can be maintained against the member details. A separate log is maintained across the website and it holds the required reports as per day, week, and month or to the extent of desired time period. Also includes an interconnected network among libraries at different places within the same database. All the web pages are created using PHP and MYSQL is used as the required database. UML modeling is used to create the basic design and flow of the application and once it is done the actual coding is done. Initially all the required web pages are created along with the database tables. The required business logic is added to improve the scope of the application and the database connections are established. Few test cases are created and manual testing is used in this project. Test cases are created in a manner to check all the required field level validations and 
also database validations. Once the application is created the corresponding test cases are executed against couple of runs and the bugs are resolved if any identified. Once the testing is done, the final product is delivered.

Technology Requirements:
✓ Software: Sublime Text
✓ Language: HTML, CSS, Php
✓ Framework / Library: Bootstrap, jQuery
✓ Database Program: MYSQL
✓ Hosting Site: GitHub

Basic UX Flow: 
Basic UX Flow idea is designed in Project Proposal of Web Based Application Project -smart Library.pdf

Drawbacks of Present system:
❖ At present there is no significant number of online library management system except for educational institutes.
❖ Fast report generation is not possible.
❖ Information about issue/return of the books are not properly maintained.
❖ Not accessible while away physically.
❖ No central database can be created as information is not available in database.

Conclusion & Benefits of proposed system:

My proposed system provides following solutions:

❖It provides “better and efficient” service to all.
❖Reduce the workload of employee.
❖Faster retrieval of information about the desired book.
❖Provide facility for proper monitoring reduce paper work and provide data security.
❖All details will be available on a click for both admin and members.
